# BeautyAd_CausalExperiment
Less than 4% of women believe they are beautiful, according to a 2011 Dove study. Beauty standards are set by unrealistic portrayals of women in the media. We are designing an experiment to determine if changing the models shown in an advertisement will cause a change in how beauty is perceived.
